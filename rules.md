# X-Team 34 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How will we assign (and reassign) tasks
Constant communication through group iMessage will enable us to assign and reassign tasks quickly and efficiently. The leader (Libby) will delegate final tasks to each person if conflict arises. Tasks will be split evenly and agreed amongst all team members.

## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Update completed tasks through iMessage and have small deadlines for tasks.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Make sure to talk about and exchange thoughts and ideas without being frustrated with each other, and make sure you are always respectful to each other's opinions.  


## How will we back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Set alarm on phone, keep each other informed on schedule, and remind each other of the deadlines. 


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Try to respond within two hours of someone's message. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you are struggling with something. Be flexible with your schedule so that meeting times can accommodate everyone.
